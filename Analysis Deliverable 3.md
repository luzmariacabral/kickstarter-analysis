# Louis' *FEVER* Kickstarter

## Overview of Project
From the Kickstarted data set presented I created a pivot table to view campaign results for other plays based on launch dates. Created a second spreadsheet with campaign outcomes based fundraising goals. Line graphs were completed for both data sets.
### Purpose
Client would like to know how other campaigns did in meeting their campaing goals and if their launch dates made a difference in their success or not. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Da
One easy and quick determination that can be meade from this data is that best months to lauch a campaign are May and June. Although failed campaigns are also high for this season the number that are successful is still in high percentage. It looks like campaigns set to start at the beginning of the year are most likely to be canceled, it's unclear if they move those starts to another time. It looks like launch date is not a determinate as to if a campaign will fail as there is a steady amount of campaigns that fail throughout the year. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
It can be determined that campaigns with lower goals were able to reach them at a higher rate that those plays with larger budgets. Obviously those that were canceled never started their campaigns and would be 0. It would be interesting to see the type of plays there were receiving the funding at higher amounts, $30K to $45K, and why other projects were unable to get funding at $25K with a failure percent of 80%.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For organizing the data, excel has some serious OCD, one wrong spelling and it would throw off your results. Combing over line by line to figure out the error was tedious but needed. Otherwise the original data set feels complete just more needs to be analyzed not just launch date and goals. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?  
Best time to launch your campaign is May or June. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Keep you fund raising goals low, under $5000 will give you a higher result. Rate of success decreases as goals are higher.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It's unclear why some campaigns were canceled?  Why those launched at successful months also failed? The theater also have musicals but we didn't review the information of goals met for musicals, only play? Is thre more interest in musicals?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can draw another goals table for theaters and analyze both plays and musicals. Check if there is more interest from donors and audiences in either type of play.
